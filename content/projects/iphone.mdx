## Features

Key features include **3D iPhone models**, **animated carousel** and a **stunning hero-section**.

Additionally, the landing-page is **fully-responsive** and has **smooth animations and transitions** .

## Stack

I used **[React.js](https://react.dev/)** with **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for this project, **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for styling, **[GSAP](https://gsap.com/)** for animations and **[React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)** for 3D development.

## Problems

The implementation of the Animated Video Carousel was very challenging. Ensuring seamless transitions between videos while tracking each video's progress required meticulous planning and execution. Leveraging multiple refs, effects, and hooks proved instrumental in achieving the desired outcome.

Rendering the 3D iPhone models presented its own set of challenges, encompassing aspects such as lighting, camera angles, and animation.

## Lessons

This project helped me learn modern technologies like GSAP and React Three Fiber, and provided an opportunity to explore the creation of dynamic web experiences and captivating animations.
